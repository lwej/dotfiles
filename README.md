# dotfiles

Files to customize *a* linux system.

**Note: This is my personal preference, and a lot of this is spaghetti.**

Currently only tested in debian and ubuntu (because *apt* is nice)



## install and config

The need for a new install has appeared, so here we go. 

```
git clone git@github.com:lwej/dotfiles.git
```

```
sh install_the_stuff.sh
```
